        Together with [Chris Roth](https://sites.google.com/site/chrisrotheconomics/home), I am the co-host of [EconGradAdvice](https://sites.google.com/view/econgradadvice/), a compilation of useful resources for aspiring and current graduate students, as well as junior faculty. 

        I also co-host the European Job Market Morning at the EEA's Annual Meeting. You can find the slides from 2024 here: [Part I](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0ah0c8ra2olaolmlwt9nb/European-Job-Market-Morning-Part-I.pdf?rlkey=2bsncygq9f5p33jrg5ooqgmss&dl=0), [Part 3](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/57bk23ejmhioywuker2m6/European-Job-Market-Morning-Part-III.pdf?rlkey=q34cemgp8wo4c16wih8ecu4dr&dl=0), [Part 4](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7ja08dlum67ueo7i47x9t/European-Job-Market-Morning-Part-IV.pdf?rlkey=10o9jqzruyjwpq6h8ot68sgpo&dl=0), and [Part 5](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gst22jarrmzz53ps7vc9t/European-Job-Market-Morning-Part-V.pdf?rlkey=t9d7nmr48ftzg8mmbayhnh3qt&dl=0).

        In my role as chairman of the European Job Market Committee for Economists, I hope to improve the experience for young scholars and recruiters in the academic job market for economists in Europe. If you have suggestions for how to improve the job market, please get in touch!
